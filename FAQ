Mini-FAQ:

  - Q: My RP is a Cisco router, but it doesn't work with pimd
    A1: If your Cisco is running PIM-SMv1, it won't work with pimd
	which implements only PIM-SMv2. You need to upgrade/configure
	your Cisco to run PIM-SMv2
    A2: If your Cisco is indeed running PIM-SMv2, and it is the RP,
	you need to recompile pimd with BROKEN_CISCO_CHECKSUM defined
	(see the beginning of Makefile). Note that then the PIM Register
	messages may not be accepted by some other vendors (pimd-to-pimd
	should still be OK).

  - Q: I have added in the past PIM patches to my *BSD kernel, but
	recent pimd versions (pimd-2.1.0-alpha29 and later) do not work
	with that kernel.
    A: Around the time pimd-2.1.0-alpha29 was created, the kernel PIM API
	was changed. Unfortunately, the result was non-compatibility.
	Either update your kernel to use the most recent API, or recompile
	pimd with PIM_OLD_KERNEL defined (see the beginning of Makefile)

  - Q: I have Solaris 8, but my kernel crashes when I start pimd
    A: There is a bug in the Solaris 8 kernel. I guess there is a patch
	that fixes it, but I don't know its location.

  - Q: Do I need to re-configure my Linux kernel to run pimd?
  - A: Very likely, yes, because some of the options below are not
	enabled by default. Make sure that you have:
	* enable CONFIG_IP_MULTICAST
	* enable CONFIG_IP_PIMSM_V2
	* enable CONFIG_IP_MROUTE
	* You _may_ enable CONFIG_IP_PIMSM_V1 as well, but I don't think it is
	  required if you are running only PIM-SMv2
	* enable the NETLINK-related options
        * Make sure that those options are set to "y" to include the relevant
          code in the kernel; if you enable them as modules, then you may
          have to load that module after you boot with the new kernel.
          One way to find-out if multicast routing is not working, is
          to use command `cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/eth0/mc_forwarding'
          after you have started pimd (you may use other interface name
          instead of eth0). If it returns zero, the multicast forwarding
          on that interface is not working.
  - Q: I tried to run pimd on Linux, but I get the following error message:
	"netlink socket: Address family not supported by protocol"
  - A: You need to enable the NETLINK-related stuff in the kernel
	and recompile it.

  - Q: pimd compiled and is running on a single machines, but when I
	run it on 2+ machines, the multicast packets do not reach the
	receivers.
  - A: Without detailed debug information I cannot answer this question.
	Please send to the pimd maintainer a scheme of your network,
        and the debug output from each router (pimd -d all)

   - Q: How do I debug my multicast routing?
   - A: Check README.debug for some hints.

   - Q: How do I use pimd with GRE tunnels?
   - A: See file README.config

   - Q: How do I run pimd but without configuring it as a Cand-RP and/or
        a Cand-BSR?
   - A: See file README.config

   - Q: How do I configure pimd to do FOO?
   - A: See file README.config. If the answer is not there, send
        email to the current pimd maintainer.
