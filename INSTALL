Installation instruction for pimd
=================================

1. Apply the PIM kernel patches, recompile, reboot

2. Copy pimd.conf to /etc and edit as appropriate. Disable the interfaces
   you don't need. Note that you need at least 2 physical interfaces
   enabled.

3. Edit Makefile by uncommenting the line(s) corresponding to your platform.

4. Recompile pimd

5. Run pimd as a root. It is highly recommended to run it in debug mode.
   Because there are many debug messages, you can specify only a subset of
   the messages to be printed out:

   usage: pimd [-c configfile] [-d [debug_level][,debug_level]]

   Valid debug levels: dvmrp_prunes, dvmrp_mrt, dvmrp_neighbors,
   dvmrp_timers, igmp_proto, igmp_timers, igmp_members, trace,timeout,
   pkt, interfaces, kernel, cache, rsrr, pim_hello, pim_register,
   pim_join_prune, pim_bootstrap, pim_asserts, pim_cand_rp, pim_routes,
   pim_timers, pim_rpf

   If you want to see all messages, use "pimd -d all" only.

6. Note that it takes of the order of 30 seconds to 1 minute until the
   Bootstrap router is elected and the RP-set distributed to the PIM
   routers, and without the RP-set in the routers the multicast packets
   cannot be forwarded.

7. There are plenty of bugs, some of them known (check BUGS.TODO), some of
   them unknown, so your bug reports are more than welcome.
